Enkil
=====

Enkil is a Python module designed to gather information about the running system.  It's similar to (and inspired by) the projects [ohai](https://github.com/opscode/ohai) and [facter](https://github.com/puppetlabs/facter).

Note: Enkil is still very much in development, so it may not work on your system.  If you come across a bug (even just a small error!), please open an issue to let me know, and I'll do my best to fix it.

Design Goals
------------

  * Simple and extensible
  * Cross-platform (Linux, OS X, and Windows)
  * Minimal - the core should be as small as possible, with as much of the logic in plugins as possible
  * Flexible - should not fail if external modules are not installed

Why "Enkil"?
-----------

Enkil is named after the Sumerian god of mischief, water, crafts, intelligence and creation (who is also known as Enki).  His symbol was the double-helix snake, and his name can be translated as "Lord of the Earth".  See the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enki) for more information.

Enkil is pronounced "en-keel" ("keel" like the part of a boat).
